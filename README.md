# Form-Validation

This project validates form fields like username, email, mobile number, password, confirm password, checks if user inputs in a form are correct before submitting. It helps prevent errors and makes sure the data entered is valid. 

✅ What It Validates:

Username - must not be empty and follow character rules

Email - must be in a proper email format (e.g., example@mail.com)

Mobile Number - must be valid and contain only digits

Password - must be strong (e.g., mix of letters, numbers, symbols)

Confirm Password - must match the password

✅ Validation Type Used:

Client-Side Validation Only: All validation is done on the client side using JavaScript.

    •  HTML5 attributes like required, type="email", and pattern are used for basic validation.

✅ Technologies Used:

HTML5 – To structure the form and use built-in validation attributes.

CSS3 – To style the form and display validation feedback clearly (e.g., red borders, error messages).

JavaScript (Vanilla JS) – To write validation logic, trigger checks on input and form submission, and dynamically show error messages.
